<resource>
    One of resources:
        brew
        pipx
        pyenv
        mas
        npm
<item>
    item to install from resources


Commands

add <item> [--installed|<item>][--sync]
        
remove <item> [--sync]

<resource> add <item> [--sync]
    add item to config

<resource> add <item> [--sync]
    add item to config
    
setup [<resource>|configs|defaults]
    simply setup whatever is defined in config. 

sync [<resource>|configs|defaults][--override {config|system|ask}][--remove]
    more complex and more powerfull than setup, allow both way syncing (config > system, system state > config)

Entities â€” come up with a better name

defaults
    apply
        apply defaults from config
    track <cmd>
        add changes in defaults caused by shell command
    snapshot
        save current state of defaults
    restore <snapshot>
        restore defaults to saved state
    diff [snapshot]
        show diff between saved and current state
    show
        show defaults that are not default (works only with user-scope defaults)
        HACK this could work by creating a temp user with sysadminctl,
        getting snapshot of defaults of that user and comparing it to current
    capture
        same as `show`, but write it to config
